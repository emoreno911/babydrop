## About the project

Babydrop allows you to send BabyDoge to anyone by using a simple link, this way you can onboard your friends to the community just by sending them a link via email or with your favorite messaging app.

To accomplish this all you have to do is to connect your wallet to the dApp and put the amount of BabyDoge you wish to send then the Smart Contract will proceed to deposit said asset in its vault and generate a unique link for it, this link can be password protected if you want. After that you can share the link with one of your friends, who can claim the tokens at any time and transfer them to a EOA or generate a social wallet (a Smart Contract wallet deployed via minimal proxy that can be associated with a Google/Facebook/Twitter account to be managed in a very similar way to web2).

The goal is to create an experience as friendly as possible for those users who have low to no contact with Crypto or DeFi, and with that to increase the number of members interacting in the BabyDoge community.

## Contribution and potential for the BabyDoge community

This project comes with a fast and easy way to attract new users to the community, because using Links and Social Wallets the entry barrier is significantly lowered and if you add to that the low BSC fees, a great incentive to experiment is created. For more experienced crypto and web3 users, it can represent a useful tool for casual transactions, giveaways and airdrops within social networks and messaging applications.

In future steps it could be a functionality to integrate within the babydogeswap.com services, including the possibility of creating links for other BRC20 tokens and paying the creation fees with BabyDoge.
